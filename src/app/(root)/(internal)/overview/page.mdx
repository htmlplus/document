# What is HTMLPlus?

**HTMLPlus** is a lightweight, framework-agnostic UI library built on native Web Components. Its goal is simple – it provides reusable, cutting-edge UI elements that work seamlessly across all JavaScript frameworks and modern browsers.

Because it’s built on the [Standard Web Platform's APIs](https://mdn.io/using-custom-elements), you can use HTMLPlus in React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, and other frameworks, or even plain JavaScript projects. It works seamlessly across all of them. For more information on how custom elements work across frameworks, see [Custom Elements Everywhere](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com).

As frameworks evolve and new ones emerge, HTMLPlus stays up to date, ensuring compatibility, reliability, and longevity for your projects.

# Why HTMLPlus?

Front-end development champions the **DRY principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**, yet developers often break it by rebuilding the same components every time they switch frameworks. This creates a **costly cycle**:

- Learning new APIs and patterns for each framework  
- Searching for libraries that are compatible and up-to-date  
- Building and maintaining custom design systems from scratch  

This fragmentation wastes time, inflates costs, and creates lasting maintenance headaches.

HTMLPlus breaks this cycle by providing one unified toolkit of reusable components that work everywhere.
