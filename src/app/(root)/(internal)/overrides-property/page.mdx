# Overrides Property

The property allows an element’s properties to be updated automatically based on active **media** or **container** breakpoints. 

When a breakpoint becomes active, the values defined in `overrides` override the element’s **default** values, enabling responsive behavior without JavaScript.

## How It Works

- Each **key** in the `overrides` object represents a **breakpoint**. See [Breakpoints](/breakpoints) for details.
- The corresponding **value** is an object containing the properties that will be applied when that breakpoint is active.

## Syntax

A general example of how the property can be used.

```html
<plus-element
  overrides='{
    "sm":  { "prop1": "value1" },
    "md":  { "prop1": "value2" },
    "@lg": { "prop2": "value3" },
    "@xl": { "prop3": "value4" },
  }'
></plus-element>
```

## Example

This example shows a `plus-stack` that is **vertical** by default and is automatically changed to **horizontal** when the container is small.

```html
<plus-stack 
  vertical
  overrides='{
    "@sm": { "vertical": false }
  }'
>
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
</plus-stack>
```
