This is probably the last huge collection of frameworkless `UI components` you'll use in your web applications as a developer.

Today, the extent of the web is not a secret to anyone. So that we see the presence of web-based applications on `Desktops`, `Phones`, `Tablets`, `Televisions`, and `IoTs`.

Also, web technologies are seen in increasing progress regularly so that is expected to become an alternative to native applications on any platform.

On the other hand, it is difficult to produce efficient web applications using web technology purely. For this reason, libraries are produced to make working with them easier.

Finally, the great diversity of libraries causes confusion in choosing, learning curve, maintenance costs, etc.

These types of problems become explosive when you want to work on several projects with various libraries at the same time or to implement concepts like `Microfrontend` or even replace one of them. And goes to the point where they force you to have your own `Design System`.

`Design systems` are one of the most basic needs of developer teams. But they are never cheap and usually impose a lot of costs to reach maturity.
